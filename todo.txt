PRIORITY: SPEED. it's currently way too slow for something this simple. Culprits are likely
the way matrices are implemented and csv_reading.

1. optimize csv reading
2. optimize matrix creation (resizing is NOT it)
3. more complex performance statistics (precision, recall, f1-score, etc.)
4. more user friendly, allow custom architecures and datasets
5. allow saving of weights and biases into file
6. gui perhaps?
